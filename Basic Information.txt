SQL = Structured Query Language

Used to 
1. Create
2. Retrieve
3. Update
4. Delete
Data from a Database

Two Types of Databases
1. Relational
(rows and coloumns)
We use SQL

2. Non Relational
(any format but a table)
We use NoSQL

We will need a software called DBMS Databse Management System
Its a workspace for us to write SQL statements

We will be working with MySQL Databse Management System
